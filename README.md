# japanese-garden
The japanese-garden project is our (group of 4) final exam of the computer graphics course at the DHBW Ravensburg in late 2021.
### Background
Japanese gardens are a place of culture and nature. They serve as an expression of Japanese history and philosophy. Through asymmetrical arrangements, there is much to discover for the visitor, as the impression of the plant changes from different angles. This awakens the visitor's attentiveness and creates a place of relaxation and tranquility. The symbolism of the complex is in the foreground. To honor this piece of Japanese thought, a 3D scene of such a garden has been created to enable any person to enjoy this place of recreation regardless of location. In this way, for a few minutes, the everyday life can be denied and the beauty of Japanese culture can be paid homage to.
